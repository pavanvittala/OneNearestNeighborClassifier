How to run code on Zeus:
1. Copy the zip file I submitted to Blackboard over to Zeus and unzip it
2. Navigate to folder with java files: /HW3_V2/
3. Run the following command: javac *.java
4. Run the following command: java -Xmx4g Vector data.txt

That's it. Wait for the code to run and it'll give you the output at the end.
It took me 100 minutes to run the entire program on the full dataset. But your
results may vary based on how busy Zeus is. So please give it the appropriate
amount of time to complete. I assure you, it is NOT in an infinite loop. 

Thank you!
